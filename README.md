# odin-recipes
This is repository will be used for the Odin Curriculum Recipe project. It will be a test of my HTML knowledge and will further my learning in said curriculum.

Looking back: This project helped me greatly, I learned several new things during the process of creating this webpage. Specifically I learned how to remove deleted files from Git and had to fix a broken file that I had made a mistake with. I now feel completely confident when working with basic HTML.
